[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

This machine learning is made to fulfill the final project of Rakamin Academy Bootcamp of Data Science Batch 22. in this project, we are data scientist of marketing team at PT. BTS. We are responsible for providing business recommendations to marketing team, analyze customer growth and optimize marketing champaigns to enchance company business performance. 

## Problem Statement
PT. BTS is a company engaged in the retail sector. To achieve sales targets, the marketing team conducts marketing campaigns that require amount of money. Irrelevant campaigns have the potential to cause customers to churn. so as data scientists, we develope machine learning models to improve customer response and optimize marketing costs. [Marketing campaign](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign) dataset can help us to determine target marketing campaign recommendations

## Work Environment
We uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- Dataset 
[Marketing campaign](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign "Marketing campaign dataset from Kaggle")

## Workflow
- Handle missing values
- Feature extraction
- Feature encoding
- Explaratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handle imbalance data
- Modelling machine learning
- Choosing best model
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature Importance
- Re-run train data & tuning after choose feature importance
